# portfolio-website
Hi there! I'm Sumit, a passionate Computer Science student at NIT Jalandhar. I love solving problems, building projects, and learning new technologies.

Over the past few years, I’ve gained experience in programming, especially in Python and Django, where I’ve worked on several projects like a banking system and a pharmacy management system. I also enjoy working on Data Structures and Algorithms and am continuously improving my skills by solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, diving into the world of Machine Learning and Data Science, or working on my portfolio website to showcase the projects I’ve worked on.

Feel free to explore my projects and contact me if you'd like to work together!
